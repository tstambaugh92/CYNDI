Chip8: Yet another Newbie Developed Interpreter
Thomas Stambaugh

An attempt at a Chip8 Interpreter using SDL2 in C++.
C++ is used instead of C because at some point I'm going to use the
windows API for file selection.

Makefile included is for Windows using MinGW 64 bit tools. Code
itself should compile fine using 32bit MinGW and SDL. At the moment,
code should run in Linux as well. No WinAPI code right now. Will
figure out how to do different make files for different OS's at a 
later time. Don't have much experience with Make.
